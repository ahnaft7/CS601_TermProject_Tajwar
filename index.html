              <h3>I'm an aspiring Software Engineer</h3>
              <p>
              Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Ahnaf Tajwar, 
              born and raised in NYC, I am currently a Software Engineering 
              Graduate Student at Boston University. I also recently completed my BS 
              in Mechanical Engineering from Boston University as well,
              but ultimately decided on pursuing the very exciting field
              of software development. I consider myself a visual and creative
              person who loves to explore everything that comes my way. 
              </p><br>
              <p>
              In my academic career, I have created many things
              from physical products to computer programs to solve and
              accomplish different tasks. I now use the experiences that
              I've had and apply them to my professional career at 
              General Motors. Although my career is just getting started,
              I am thrilled to work for such a visionary company that is 
              working towards a more sustainable future. My goal is to use both of my
              engineering perspectives to develop robust and user friendly software.
