              <p>Over the past several years, I have had many meaningful opportunities
                that have allowed me to experience working with different types of people
                and organizations. Each of these experiences have taught me something
                different and helped me develop my skills as an engineer and team player.

                    During my second role at GM as a Software Integration Engineer, I tested Access 
                    and Security features in various vehicle programs accounting for every potential
                    user case. I engaged in troubleshooting Diagnostic Trouble Codes that arise after 
                    testing by understanding the software architecture. I developed feature checklists 
                    to document future feature checkout requirements. In addition, communicating cross 
                    functionally with people across the organization to root cause and confirm issues
                    was key to being successful.

                    As a Project Engineer at GM working in Seat Components, I have worked on seats plastics that
                    the customer interfaces with on a daily basis. My role included creating a catalog of 
                    User Defined Features (UDF) in NX that designers would use when designing future plastic 
                    parts for seat trim. These UDFs would be an easier and more time efficient way to import
                    designs that are known to work while minimizing carryover error. I also designed a parameterized 
                    snap clip in NX that automatically generates an optimal design given some user desired parameters.
                    In addition, I conducted FEA studies to analyze stress loads and ensure part rigidity.

                    As a Corrosion Technician Intern at PSEG, I worked with gas piping to measure the
                    corrosion protection on them. Valuing company integrity was crucial for this role because
                    people's safety was at risk if I did not collect and communicate accurate corrosion protection
                    readings everyday. I used tools such as multimeter, GIS Maps, and PPE to perform my tasks.
