              <p>Over the years, I have engaged in many different activities,
                whether it be with friends or solo. However, some of my favorite
                things to do are the following:
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
              <ul>
                <li>Photography</li>
                <li>Traveling</li>
                <li>Driving</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Photography has been something I was really interested in learning after seeing
                so many cool photos online especially after Instagram became popular.
                I recently purchased a DSLR camera and am always looking for an opportunity
                to take it out and shoot. My next big purchase will be a video drone that I can
                take on my next travel destination.
              </p>
              <p>
                Traveling has been a big part of my goals recently, after I realized time isn't
                waiting for anyone. Every year I plan to travel to at least one international destination
                with family and friends. A life goal of mine is to travel to every country across the globe
                at least once.

                Driving is incredibly fun to me, in contrast to a lot of you I'm sure.
                I see driving as a way to de-stress and let my mind go where it wants.
                I also just enjoy the aspect of controlling a vehicle to transport me somewhere.
                This definitely must have influenced my mechanical background.
