              <p>Over the years, I have engaged in many different activities,
                whether it be with friends or solo. However, some of my favorite
                things to do are shown below!

                Photography has been something I was really interested in learning after seeing
                so many cool photos online especially after Instagram became popular.
                I recently purchased a DSLR camera and am always looking for an opportunity
                to take it out and shoot. My next big purchase will be a video drone that I can
                take on my next travel destination.

                Traveling has been a big part of my goals recently, after I realized time isn't
                waiting for anyone. Every year I plan to travel to at least one international destination
                with family and friends. A life goal of mine is to travel to every country across the globe
                at least once.

                Driving is incredibly fun to me, in contrast to a lot of you I'm sure.
                I see driving as a way to de-stress and let my mind go where it wants.
                I also just enjoy the aspect of controlling a vehicle to transport me somewhere.
                This definitely must have influenced my mechanical background.
